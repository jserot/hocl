- clarify the description of "src" and "snk" nodes in .pi files concerning the cfg inputs :
  + preesm seems to accept the explicit form ...
  + ... but some examples in the repo (ex: SIFT) seem to omit the decl of cfg input ports in src and snk nodes ..
  + the current implementation of [hoclc] and [pi2hcl] use the explicit form
- support expr-annot for subgraphs src and snk nodes (cf SIFT/Htop_sift.pi/{image}src for ex)
- reverse-interpretation of .pi files
- cluster-based drawing of hierarchy graphical in the .dot backend (?)
- implementation of hierarchy in the SystemC backend
- unify external (and internal) representation of data and cfg I/Os. For ex
  . source (resp. sink) nodes are just actors with no refinement
- dynamic parameters
- Dune-based build process
