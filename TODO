GENERAL
- find a smarter name ?

COMPILER
- merged decls (ex: wire w1,w2: int)
- check that types infered from a node impl match those given in the interface (typing.ml)
- allow arbitrary infix operators to be defined in prelude or elsewhere (the set of such operators
  is currently restricted by the lexer)
- relocalize backend-specific error handling fns in the corresp. source file (?)

DOT BACKEND
- cluster-based drawing of hierarchy graphical in the .dot backend (?)

SYSTEMC BACKEND
- -sc_stop_idle option

PREESM BACKEND
- clarify the description of "src" and "snk" nodes in .pi files concerning the cfg inputs :
  + preesm seems to accept the explicit form ...
  + ... but some examples in the repo (ex: SIFT) seem to omit the decl of cfg input ports in src and snk nodes ..
  + the current implementation of [hoclc] and [pi2hcl] use the explicit form
- support expr-annot for src and snk nodes in subgraphs (cf SIFT/Htop_sift.pi/{image}src for ex)
- dynamic parameters
- delays
- conditional activation of actors (to support parameter-based conditional, a la PiSDF)

DIF BACKEND

VHDL BACKEND

TOOLS/PI2HCL
- translation of cyclic graphs (ex: examples/sift)
- handling of delay nodes (ex: examples/sift)
- implicit vs. explicit cfg inputs for src/snk nodes
- port annotations (vs. expr)

DOC
- update tutorial with support for bcast and bcast nodes
- add a section on recursive fns/graphs (with example [misc/recfilt])

DIST
- build lib/etc/Makefile.app by instantiating a template with paths obtained from configure
