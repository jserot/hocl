GENERAL
- find a smarter name (higher orDEr DAtaflow Language, VErsatile Dataflow sImulAtor and coMpiler) 
- describe as hl language for description, simulation and code generation of DF apps
- backends :
  . dot (for visu)
  . systemc (for simulation)
  . dif (for i/f to anl tools)
  . preesm (for code generation on HMC platforms)
  . caph (for code generation on HW platforms (with actors described in VHDL))
  . cal (?)
- interface/implementation-based descriptions
- make all examples simulable in SystemC

COMPILER
- allow arbitrary infix operators to be defined in prelude or elsewhere (the set of such operators
  is currently restricted by the lexer)
- make processing of prelude automatic by default (with an option [-no_prelude])
- "delay" specific keyword for delay actors (instead of "actor") ?
- clarify the description of "src" and "snk" nodes in .pi files concerning the cfg inputs :
  + preesm seems to accept the explicit form ...
  + ... but some examples in the repo (ex: SIFT) seem to omit the decl of cfg input ports in src and snk nodes ..
  + the current implementation of [hoclc] and [pi2hcl] use the explicit form
- support expr-annot for src and snk nodes in subgraphs (cf SIFT/Htop_sift.pi/{image}src for ex)
- unify specification of IOs for toplevel graph and hierarchical subgraphs (the former are described as actors,
  the latter as "source"/"sink" special nodes
- cluster-based drawing of hierarchy graphical in the .dot backend (?)
- implementation of hierarchy in the SystemC backend
- dynamic parameters

PI2HCL
- translation of cyclic graphs (ex: examples/sift)
- handling of delay nodes (ex: examples/sift)
- implicit vs. explicit cfg inputs for src/snk nodes
- port annotations (vs. expr)

DOC
- rewrite all doc with the 1.0 syntax
- update tutorial with support for bcast and bcast nodes
- add a section on recursive fns/graphs (with example [misc/recfilt])

DIST
- build lib/etc/Makefile.app by instantiating a template with paths obtained from configure
