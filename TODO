- gather all HOWFs into prelude
- ignore patter
- infix compose operator ">>", so that "o (f (i ()))" can be written "() >> i >> f >> o" 
- ... or even better, with a specialized op "|>" : "i |> f >> o"
- user defined infix ops (ex: net [(>>) x f = f x]) ?
- network level constants (esp. when describing [foldl]-based nets) 
  (could be further translated to input-less constant gen actors or parameters)
