\chapter{The \caph standard libraries}
\label{cha:stdlib}

The \caph distribution comes with a small set of ``libraries'' containing definitions of actors and
functions which are likely to be frequently used in signal or image processing applications :

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|dc.cph| contains the definition of the \verb|dc| type (see Sec.~\ref{sec:type-declarations}),
\item \verb|list_ops.cph| contains the definitions of actors performing back and forward delays on lists of values,
\item \verb|img_ops.cph| contains the definitions of actors and wiring functions for manipulating images
  (horizontal and vertical delays, neighborhood generation, \ldots),
\item \verb|convol.cph| contains the definitions of actors performing convolutions on lists and images,
\item \verb|stream_ops.cph| contains the definitions of actors performing various operations on
  \emph{unstructured} streams.
\end{itemize}

Most of the actors (resp. functions) are polymorphic and accept parameters making them sufficiently
generic to be used in a large variety of contexts.

To use a library, one simply has to include it in the program, using the \verb|#include| directive
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:file-inclusion}. For example, a program using the \verb|dc| type
will start with the following line :

\begin{lstlisting}
#include "dc.cph"
\end{lstlisting}

The location of the standard libraries must be specified with the \verb|-I| option (see Sec.~\ref{cha:compiler-options}).
