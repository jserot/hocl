\chapter{Syntax}
\label{chap:syntax}

This appendix gives a BNF definition of the concrete syntax for \hocl programs.  The meta-syntax is
conventional. Keywords are written in \textbf{bold} and non-terminals like $\gramnonterm{this}$.
Vertical bars {\tt |} are used to indicate alternatives.  Constructs enclosed in brackets {\tt [}
$\ldots$ {\tt ]} are optional. The notation $\grameps$ denotes an empty construct. The notation
\gramseplist{s}{E} (resp.~\gramsepnelist{s}{E}) denotes a list of zero (resp. one) or more elements
$E$ separated by $s$. Value-attributed terminals are denoted like \textit{this}. The terminals
\textit{infix3}, \textit{infix2} and \textit{infix0} respectively correspond to infix operators
\{\verb|*|,\verb|/|,\verb|%|\}, \{\verb|+|,\verb|-|\} and
\{\verb|@@|, \verb'|>', \verb'|->'\}. The other definitions (\textit{ident}, \textit{int},
\textit{string}) are classical.
