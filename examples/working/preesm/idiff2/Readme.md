This application computes and displays the image difference (Ik-Ik-1) on a YUV video stream
This is a HoCL reformulation of the Preesm example available at :
   https://github.com/preesm/preesm-apps/tree/master/org.ietr.preesm.difference (difference2)
Note : the use of an explicit broadcast actor is required by the Preesm backend here
